// Archived legacy script.js — preserved by automation on 2025-11-22
// Original content moved from `script.js`. Use `app.js` as the runtime entrypoint instead.

/*
The original `script.js` contained deprecated/duplicate logic and is preserved here for
reference only. It is not loaded by `index.html` and should not be used at runtime.
*/

// See `app.js` for the active, consolidated application code.
